### Reflections and Comments

* I've converted the first 5 questions of the quiz to a loop that uses an array of questions, answers, and responses.
* I've implemented a random-number generator on Question 6 to change the answer every time a user comes to the page.
* I need to remember that the response to a `prompt` is always a `string` and I need to use the `parseInt()` function to change it into a `number`.
